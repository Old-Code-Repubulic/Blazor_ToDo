##Microsoft Learning Patch for Blazor ToDo App: https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/learn/modules/build-blazor-webassembly-visual-studio-code/3-exercise-configure-enviromnent

###Purpose
<p>
    After completing the very quick tutorial on the Microsoft docs for Blazor, I decided I needed to find a lengthier tutorial. The Blazor App in this repository will be created as I go through the learning patch linked in the header. I hope to better understand the blazor components. I also plan to follow this tutorial with the React online tutorial, as I'm sensing a familar pattern between the two.
